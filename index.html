        <p>Pokémon is a globally popular franchise that began in 1996 with the release of Pokémon Red and Green. The core idea revolves around catching, training, and battling creatures known as Pokémon. Each Pokémon has different types, abilities, and evolutions. The main goal in the games is to become a skilled Pokémon Trainer by collecting badges, battling Gym Leaders, and eventually becoming the Pokémon Champion.</p>

        <p>One of the most beautiful aspects of Pokémon is the relationship between Trainers and their Pokémon. This theme is strongly emphasized in the anime series, especially through the bond between Ash and his Pikachu. Pokémon are not just tools for battle—they are friends, partners, and sometimes even saviors who help stop villains and protect the world.</p>

        <p>Battling in Pokémon involves strategy. Players choose four moves for each Pokémon, and battles are based on turn-based mechanics. Each Pokémon has one or two types, like Fire, Water, or Electric, and type advantages play a crucial role in winning battles. Trainers also use held items, abilities, and tactics like switching to gain the upper hand.</p>

        <p>Over time, Pokémon has grown into more than just a game. There's an anime series with hundreds of episodes, a trading card game, mobile apps like Pokémon GO, and even movies. It has also inspired merchandise, fan events, and a worldwide community of players who continue to enjoy the magic of the Pokémon world.</p>

        <p>Even after decades, Pokémon continues to capture the hearts of both kids and adults. Its blend of exploration, friendship, and strategy makes it timeless. For many fans, Pokémon is not just a game—they see it as a part of their childhood and something they’ll always carry with them.</p>
